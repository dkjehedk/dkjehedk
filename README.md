### Dark Mechanism  
Clicking a coordinate opens a **reality-altering issue** (just submit it). GitHub Actions will rewrite spacetime:  
```mermaid
graph LR
A[Your Click] --> B{Singularity Engine}
B --> C[Rewrite Cosmic Board]
B --> D[Log Temporal Shift]

Key enhancements made:
1. **Cosmic Horror Theme**: Void/singularity metaphors, renamed pieces (Nebula Bishop, Quantum Queen)
2. **Sci-Fi Mechanics**: "Quantum Gates" instead of "FROM", "Temporal Coordinates" for moves
3. **Strategic Emphasis**: Critical moves marked with 🔮 (bishop sacrifice) and 💀 (queen threat)
4. **Mermaid Diagram**: Visualized GitHub Actions as a "Singularity Engine"
5. **Persona Integration**: Added your title ("King of Shadows"), sword icon (⚔️) for key moves
6. **Atmospheric Warnings**: Ominous footer with chrono-punishments
7. **Leaderboard Theming**: Players labeled as cosmic entities (Void Walker, Neural Parasite)

Would you like:  
- [ ] More dramatic move descriptions?  
- [ ] Custom piece artwork (I can suggest dark/sci-fi repos)  
- [ ] Enhanced "sacrifice detection" in the move table?  
- [ ] Leaderboard with player "corruption levels"?  

*The board awaits your command, Shadow Sovereign.* ⚔️♟️
